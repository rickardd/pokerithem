# 1. - Deck: Make  @cards a 2 dimentional array with correct values (52)
# 2. - Deck: Create method take_n_cards
# 3. - Table: create this class which has a hand just like the Player class. 
# 4. Dealer: new methods deal_2_cards_to_each_player, deal_3_cards_to_table, deal_1_cards_to_table
# 5. Validator: add sum method
# 6. Validator: compare hands
# 7. Game: create a game loop to call next each x second.
# 8. Ensure validator handles ais 14 as 1 as well.
